# Web Development Project
##### by Alfie Reeves

## Overview

This is my first substantial web development project, primarily created out of general interest as well as to help develop a better understanding of 3-Dimensional Graphics 
and 3D Vectors (regarding the matrix/vector visualiser).

## Current Features

At this point in time, this project consists only of:
- ***Simple Calculator***
  - Performs very simple arithmetic similar to the calculator app on your mobile device
  - Automatically performs calculations prior to the one you are currently entering
- ***Quadratic Solver***
  - Calculates both values of x and returns them for the user to see
  - Even works with complex numbers!
- ***Matrix/Vector Visualiser***
  - The most challenging yet most enjoyable feature to implement, this visualiser allows the user to input
  3-Dimensional vectors and perform matrix transformations which can be applied on any of the currently created vectors; original or transformed.
  The user can also remove created vectors at will, including transformed vectors.

## Future Intentions

Whilst I personally believe the project to be in it's first "stable" state, I still have many ideas and features that I wish to implement gradually over time.

Some ideas that pop into mind are:

<sup>Italic = High Priority</sup>

- *Implementation of direction vectors*
  - **r** = ai + bj + ck + *Î»*(di + ej + fk)
- *Implementation of 3-Dimensional Planes*
  - **r.n = k**
  - **n<sub>1</sub> x + n<sub>2</sub> y + n<sub>3</sub> z = k**
- Graphical representation of Quadratic Solver's results
  - Show the roots via a graphical medium, similar to Desmos.
