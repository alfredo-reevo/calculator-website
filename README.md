# Web Development Project
##### by Alfie Reeves

## Overview

# ***CURRENTLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH MOBILE DEVICES***

This is my first substantial web development project, primarily created out of general interest as well as to help develop a better understanding of 3-Dimensional Graphics 
and 3D Vectors (regarding the matrix/vector visualiser).

## Current Features

At this point in time, this project consists only of:
- ***Simple Calculator***
  - Performs very simple arithmetic similar to the calculator app on your mobile device
  - Automatically performs calculations prior to the one you are currently entering
- ***Quadratic Solver***
  - Calculates both values of x and returns them for the user to see
  - Also works with complex numbers
- ***Matrix/Vector Visualiser***
  - This visualiser allows the user to add, remove, manipulate and represent
  3-Dimensional vectors and apply matrix transformations.
  The user can also remove created vectors at will, including transformed vectors.
  
  - #### Points
    - The "Points" Feature allows you to create visible points within the 3D space, similarly to creating vectors.
      Points can be useful for finding intersections between vectors, and can make visualising more complicated vector combinations 
      much easier.
  
  - ##### Planes
    - The "Planes" feature allows you to create visible planes within the 3D space, through the equation
      ***ax + by + cz = d***,
      otherwise known as **Hessian Normal Form**.
      
      I intend to add automatic intersection calculations to show the user where a vector may intersect with the plane.
  
  
  - ##### Parametric Vectors
    - Parametric vectors are an alternative object to singular vectors; consisting of a general point and a subsequent parametric point.
    
    **r = ai + bj + ck + λ(di + ej + fk)**
    
    where λ is a parameter.

## Future Intentions

Whilst I personally believe the project to be in it's first "stable" state, I still have many ideas and features that I wish to implement gradually over time.

Some ideas that pop into mind are:

<sup>Italic = High Priority</sup>

- Guidelines
- Graphical representation of Quadratic Solver's results
  - Show the roots via a graphical medium, similar to Desmos.
